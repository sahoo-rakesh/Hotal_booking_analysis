## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

### (1) Removing Duplicate rows
All duplicate rows were dropped.

### (2) Handling null values
- Null values in columns `company` and `agent` were replaced by 0.
- Null values in column `country` were replaced by 'others'.
- Null values in column `children` were replaced by the mean of the column.
  

### (3) Converting columns to appropriate data types

- Changed data type of `children`, `company`, `agent` to int type.
- Changed data type of `reservation_status_date` to date type.

### (4) Removing outliers

- One outlier was found in the `adr` column. Simply dropped it.

### (5) Creating new columns
- Created new column `total_stay` by adding `stays_in_weekend_nights`+`stays_in_week_nights`.
- Created new column `total_people` by adding `adults`+`children`+`babies`.
## Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed EDA and tried answering the following questions:
```
Q1)Which agent makes most no. of bookings?
Q2)Which room type is in most demand and which room type generates highest adr?
Q3) Which meal type is most preffered meal of customers?
Q4) What is percentage of bookings in each hotel?
Q5) which hotel seems to make more revenue?
Q6)Which hotel has higher lead time?
Q7) What is preferred stay length in each hotel?
Q8) Which hotel has longer waiting time?
Q9) Which hotel has higher bookings cancellation rate?
Q10) Which hotel has high chance that its customer will return for another stay?
Q11) Which is the most common channel for booking hotels?
Q12) Which channel is mostly used for early booking of hotels?
Q13) Which channel has longer average waiting time?
Q14) Which distribution channel brings better revenue generating deals for hotels?
Q15)From where the most guests are coming ?
Q16)How long do people stay at the hotels?

```
## Challenges
```
(1) There was a lot of duplicate data.
(2) Data was present in wrong datatype format.
(3) Choosing appropriate visualization techniques to use was difficult.
(4) A lot of null values were there in the dataset.
